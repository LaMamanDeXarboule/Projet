# 2048RPG
Game in C++ created for my engineering courses at Télécom SudParis option JIN during my second year.
The goal of this game is to reach the chest at the bottom right of the map. Random encounters can appear with a 2048 game to solve.
The characteristic of this game is that the game is in binary, your goal is to reach 1001 twice.
